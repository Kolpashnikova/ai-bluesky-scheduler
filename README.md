# AI Bluesky Scheduler

**Last updated:** June 18, 2025

## Overview

Bluesky Post Scheduler is a browser extension that helps you schedule and automatically post content to Bluesky using AI-assisted content generation. We take your privacy seriously and do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to our own servers. This policy explains how your data is used, stored, and protected.

---

## Data You Provide

- **Bluesky Credentials** (identifier and app password)
- **OpenAI API Key** (optional, for AI features)
- **Post Content** (text you want to schedule)
- **Scheduling Preferences** (dates, times, style settings)

You enter these values directly into the extension's interface. They are used only to authenticate with external services (Bluesky, OpenAI) and are never shared or transmitted elsewhere.

---

## How Data Is Stored

### Secure Local Storage Options

**Encrypted Mode (Default):**
When you choose **Encrypted** mode, your credentials and API key are encrypted *in your browser* before being saved to Chrome's local storage:
1. A key is derived from your machine fingerprint (browser user agent, language, screen size, timezone offset) using PBKDF2
2. Data is encrypted with AES-GCM via SubtleCrypto and stored as ciphertext plus IV
3. Decryption uses the same machine-derived key
4. Data persists until you manually clear it or uninstall the extension

**Session-Only Mode:**
In **Session** mode, your API key is stored only in Chrome's session storage and automatically deleted when you close your browser. Your Bluesky credentials remain encrypted in local storage for convenience.

### Scheduled Posts Storage
Your scheduled posts (content, dates, times) are stored locally in Chrome's storage and never transmitted to external servers except when being posted to Bluesky at the scheduled time.

### No Remote Storage
All data stays on your device. We do **not** send your credentials, API keys, or personal data to any remote server under any circumstance.
